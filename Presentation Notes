Introductions
  *Each Team Member (5 sec) - Name and School
  *We created Skydrive TexTy, which allows you to SMS commands to your SkyDrive

Skydrive Texty can get links to your files given a full or partial filename via SMS. If multiple results are found it offers intelligent subfiltering to find one unique result. It also allows you to write notes on the go to your skydrive, just type "note" and your message, and send the SMS. The last feature completed this weekend is the ability to download files to your skydrive - just send "dl" and your URL, and it'll be waiting in  your SkyDrive when you get back. We can't wait to explore the potential of this project by converting voice to text - imagine telling SIRI to manipulate yout dropbox! Now we'd like to demo Skydrive TexTy for you.
